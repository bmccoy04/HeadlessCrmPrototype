Hey Greg!

Change this file.

Create a Github Account then do a simple tutorial to complete a pull request.

This is a source control system.  It's probably the most important tool for software developers.

Once you complete a successful "pull request" we'll start building the beginnings of our project.

[Git Hub walk though!](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) -- How we will work w/ each other.

[Vs Code, best IDE ever!](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -- What I will mostly use for development.

[Asp.Net Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) -- The framework we will use to build the app.

Do the walk through then install the other two things. Once you complete this you will be one step ahead of pretty much every Jr. Developer out there.
